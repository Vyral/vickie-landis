<center><em>Here&rsquo;s how COVID-19 has impacted the real estate process in Pennsylvania. </em></center>

<center>&nbsp;</center>

Since the stay-at-home order was put in place, it became illegal for real estate agents to show properties in person, which has had an obvious impact on home sales. Mind you, homes are still selling, just not at the rate that we would’ve expected given the trending we’d observed prior to the pandemic.&nbsp;

Ours was a seller’s market all through 2019, and it’s still a seller’s market, though with the onset of the virus, many sellers began to pull their properties off the market, and buyers took a step back to assess what was going on.

Within the last several weeks, though, **buyers have come back to the market**, which has become very demanding. We’re getting multiple bids on properties, even in a time when buyers can’t physically preview a property. These are all signs that we need to pay attention to.

According to the governor’s plan to reopen Pennsylvania, **as soon as the county you live in turns yellow on the map that tracks infection rates, agents can go back to work, and sellers can let buyers into their homes to preview their properties before they submit an offer.**

If you’re a seller who wants to get your property on the market, don’t wait—as soon as the light turns green (or in this case, yellow), buyers will already be lined up at the starting gate before they bust through and snatch up all the properties available for purchase. A seller who waits is likely to get lost in the competition of the other listings that flood the market.

If you’re a buyer who hasn’t already gotten pre-approved for a loan and you haven’t aligned yourself with a real estate professional who can negotiate on your behalf, **you need to do that now.** You can’t bust through the gates and win the negotiation game if you don’t have the proper foundation laid.

My team and I are here to help you. If you have any questions or need any assistance, reach out to us. We’re happy to give you information and the resources you need so that you’ll be ready when the light turns yellow.
