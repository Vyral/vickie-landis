&nbsp;

Here are some questions that every home seller should be asking before listing their property for sale:

**1\. What should my list price be?** You want to price your home where it will be selected over the competition. The answer to this question will fluctuate as other properties come on and off the market. The price where you will be most competitive may change. Buyers search for homes primarily on the internet and they’re typically looking at prices from lowest to highest. Make sure you’re looking at all of your competition on the day you list, and price it where it’s going to show up first.

**2\. What’s my best-case/ worst-case scenario?** This is important for planning out your pricing strategy. Your list price should be competitive, but you should also be prepared for anything.

**3\. What will my property appraise for?** When you’re in a competitive market, buyers may be willing to pay more for the property than what it will appraise for. The buyer will hire an appraiser who will come up with the home’s value based on past sales data. If you’re in a market where prices are moving up, the highest offer you get may not actually be the best. You might want to consider an offer that’s more likely to appraise based on realistic data. The best offer is not always the highest offer.

Stay tuned for our next blog that will cover the three other questions you should also be asking before you list. If you have questions about selling your home, buying a home, or anything else related to real estate in the meantime, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
