<center><em>Here are three ways to juggle your home sale and your new home purchase.</em></center>

&nbsp;

A lot of people we’ve been talking to recently really want to sell their homes and get into bigger, better properties. Right now, low interest rates have led to high demand and low inventory. Homeowners want to take advantage of these conditions, but there’s nothing for them to move into at the moment, so they’re being held back in a sense.&nbsp;

**The problem is that home sellers aren’t taking offers with home sale contingencies, so you need to be especially competitive as a buyer so your offer will get accepted.** Here are a few tips to help you compete and ease your worries about becoming homeless:

**1\. Ask for is a longer settlement date.** Maybe negotiate a 60-day period as opposed to the normal 30- or 45-day closing. This will give you plenty of time to sell your home, find a new home, and get your offer accepted on it.

**2\. Sale and lease-back.** Maybe you need another month or two in your current home after selling so you can find your new one. With a sale and lease back, you don’t have that extra contingency and therefore you’re a much stronger buyer in the eyes of a seller.

**3\. Get a swing loan.** They’ll take the equity from your current house to use as the down payment for your second house. You won’t have to worry about the home sale contingency in this case either.

There are your three options for easing the worries about becoming homeless in this incredible seller’s market. If you have any other questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
