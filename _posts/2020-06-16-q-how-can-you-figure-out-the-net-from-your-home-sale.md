<center><em>Here&rsquo;s what to be sure to include when calculating your net amount.</em></center>

&nbsp;

As a seller, it’s important to understand what your net walk-away dollar amount will be, and this can be figured out using current market data. The real estate agent you hire should be able to bring all the relevant information to the table.&nbsp;

In addition to state transfer fees that need to be paid, **you need to consider tax prorations if you haven’t paid your property taxes yet.** That’s all money that you’ll have to bring to the table—it’ll be a charge to you versus a credit. Sometimes, when real estate agents do your prorations, they may not have that dollar amount right, especially if you don’t escrow your real estate taxes, so always double-check this. Before you even list your home, it’s wise to figure out whether you’ll need to pay any real estate taxes at settlement.&nbsp;

You should also budget for any unpaid interest on your mortgage. Mortgage interest is paid in arrears, meaning that each monthly payment takes care of the interest that has accrued from the month prior. So, if you settle in the middle of the month, you’ll have a half-month’s worth of interest to bring to the table.&nbsp;

Again, **the good news is that none of these expenses need to be surprises;** you can calculate all of these costs ahead of time so you know what you’ll have leftover to put toward a new home, retirement, or even a snazzy night out at the casino\!&nbsp;

Jokes aside, knowledge truly is power, and I’d even suggest that you consider the best- and worst-case scenarios. What is the most you could expect to get for your home based on market value and potential appraised value? What is the lowest you could expect to get? Once you have all of the numbers crunched for each scenario, you **plan for the worst and pray for the best.**

This mentality is not only financially prudent, but it will spare you unnecessary stresses throughout the real estate transaction process.&nbsp;

Lastly, it’s key to hire a real estate team that knows how to navigate the process. If your agent is not providing the information you need to make these calculations as accurately as possible, then you may be working with the wrong one.&nbsp;
