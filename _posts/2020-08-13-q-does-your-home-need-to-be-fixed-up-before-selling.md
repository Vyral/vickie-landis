*&nbsp;Here’s how to tell whether you should fix up your home before selling.*

Whether or not you should fix up your home before selling it depends on your situation: what you need, what your goals are, and what you need to have happen upon sale.&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

**Before answering the question of whether or not to fix up your home before selling, here are several other questions you should answer first:**

**1\.** Is timing an issue? In other words, how quickly do you need to sell?

**2\.** How much cash equity upon sale do you need to pull from the house in order to make your next move?&nbsp;

**3\.** How much cash on hand do you have to make improvements? Even though it’ll enable you to sell for a higher amount, can you sustain the risk of borrowing the money to make improvements if your property doesn’t sell?

**4\.** What’s your current mortgage balance (or anything else that needs to be paid off upon sale)?

**5\.** What would your property sell for as is versus fixed up?&nbsp;

**6\.** What direction is the real estate market moving? Are home values trending up or down? Are there any anticipated shifts?

**7\.** What repairs and improvements need to be made and what would they cost? Can you make them yourself or hire a professional? If you’re hiring a professional, you’ll want to get quotes so you’ll have real numbers to help you plan accordingly.

**Once you have answers to these questions, it will become much clearer which improvements, if any, need to be made before selling.** The good news is, all of them can be answered during an initial consultation with a knowledgeable real estate professional.
