*Here’s why every homebuyer should seek professional representation. *

With the market moving so fast and being so low on inventory, buyers are scrambling to find properties. When you’re out and about and see a house for sale, you may be tempted to pick up the phone and make a call right away to the number listed on the sign. Be mindful, though, that you’ll be contacting a listing agent who is under contract with that seller and has a fiduciary responsibility to represent their interests. **By simply telling the listing agent how anxious you are to get into that property, you’re already disclosing too much information** that could work against you.&nbsp;

It’s important to know that in the state of Pennsylvania, you have the right to buyer’s representation. That means you’re able tohave an agent working on your behalf to get you in to see the house, write up a contract, champion your interests in negotiations, and guide you to the closing table. When there are two independent agents working on a deal, each representing the other party, it creates more options for everyone involved and increases the likelihood of striking a win-win deal. **If only the seller has representation, then the transaction is lopsided; you as a buyer simply won’t have the leverage you need.&nbsp;**

The best part about working with a buyer’s agent? The listing broker’s office pays their commission. Rarely in life are you able to receive professional representation at no cost to you, so why would you not take advantage of this practice? Granted, you may find a house that’s for sale by the owner, in which case you’ll likely have to pay some compensation for the services of a real estate expert. Even still, that compensation can be negotiated upon entering into a transaction with an FSBO seller.&nbsp;
