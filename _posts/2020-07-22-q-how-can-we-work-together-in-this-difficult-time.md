<center><em>We have a simple request of you that could make a huge impact.</em></center>

&nbsp;

What would you do if you were trying to move your parents from the city or from a nursing home to get them closer to you so you can care for them as they age, and you couldn’t find a home suitable for their needs? What would you do if you finally found your dream job, but had to move to a new city where nothing is available? What would you do if you got married and couldn’t find a home for you and your spouse to start your new life together? My team and I help our clients answer questions like these every single day.

**Amid an incredibly competitive real estate market, my team and I are pulling out all of the stops to help our clients find the homes that they’re looking for.**&nbsp;

I’ve been selling real estate for over 30 years and have yet to see a market quite like this one. Interest rates are at an all-time low, buyer demand is insanely high, yet homeowners are still hesitant to list their homes. This is understandable given all the uncertainty created by COVID-19.

If we haven’t learned anything else from this season, I hope we’re learning this: **Everything works better when we work together.** While the world is trying to adjust to a new normal, we need each other's help to deliver for those that we love and care about. That’s why I’m asking for your help today.

As you go through your day, you may run into someone who is considering selling a house but waiting to do so. **All we need you to do is make a connection.** When you introduce a potential home seller to us, we can make a potential connection with a potential buyer for their property.&nbsp;

It will only take you a moment. Shoot us an email, a text, or call us. In that moment, you could change someone's life forever.

If you have any other questions for me about the real estate market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Thanks in advance for your incredible support.
