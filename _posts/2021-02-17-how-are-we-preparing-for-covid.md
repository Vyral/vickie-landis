<center><em>Here&rsquo;s a rundown of how we&rsquo;re protecting you from COVID.</em></center>

&nbsp;

It seems as though we've begun to ease out of the worst of the pandemic, and as more vaccines roll out, we're hopefully on the path back to relative normalcy. In the meantime, however, we still need to take a lot of precautions. As Realtors, we owe a certain duty to our clients and the owners of homes we enter for showings. Today I want to talk about the kinds of precautions Realtors are taking to ensure everyone’s safety.

For buyers, **we always take a verbal assessment to make sure they’re not sick or displaying any symptoms**, and we also have them sign a document that verifies as much. If they have had symptoms, then we wouldn’t take them into anyone’s home for showings, but if they haven’t, then we can proceed as planned.&nbsp;

When we do take buyers into properties, we ensure that everyone (agents and buyers alike) wears a mask. We also have everyone use hand sanitizer before going into a property and upon exiting it. Additionally, we usually try to have one person responsible for opening the doors, cabinets, and cupboards. That way, we reduce the risk of spreading the virus via surface contact, and the buyers still get to peek inside all the rooms and areas of the house.&nbsp;

For sellers, we leave hand sanitizer for the agents and buyers who come into their homes to use. We also leave a container of antibacterial wipes so that the homeowners can wipe down surfaces, doorknobs, and anything else that visitors may have touched while touring the home. We do the same verbal assessment of health for sellers that we do for buyers to ensure there’s no risk of spreading the virus.

In terms of settlements, **sellers are encouraged to do what’s called a deed package so they don’t have to physically be present at the settlement table.** The fewer people in the room, the better. The seller fills out the deed package so that they can go to the title company or notary ahead of time, and they can use technology to sign remotely or else authorize their agent to sign on their behalf. Buyers must still go to the settlement table, but since there are fewer people present for the process, social distancing is easier to maintain, and so the risk of spread is mitigated.

By now, we’re somewhat used to navigating the COVID lifestyle, nevertheless, the Vickie Landis Rentsel Team is trying very, very hard not to drop the ball when it comes to your safety. We want you to be able to buy and/or sell your house safely so that you have one less thing to worry about.

If you have any questions about our COVID precautions or buying or selling real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to help you.
