By now, it’s likely no surprise to hear that inventory levels in our real estate market are low—the media have been talking about it for most of the year. That said, things are crazier than ever right now, and it’s hard for those outside of the industry to truly understand just how low inventory is.&nbsp;

Let’s back up a bit and review how experts determine whether we’re in a buyer’s or a seller’s market. If we were to have six months’ worth of inventory, we’d find ourselves in a balanced market. However, **any market that has less than six months’ worth of inventory favors sellers, while any market with more than six months’ worth favors buyers.** Based on the latest market stats from October, we’re hovering 1.5 months’ worth of inventory.&nbsp;

Inventory is so low that you’ll have to compete against multiple offers for the most decently priced, well-maintained properties out there. As a buyer in this ultra-seller’s market, you need to have a strategic plan in place before you even start browsing the market. Know exactly what it is you’re after in a new home, know exactly how much you can afford, and know the areas/neighborhoods you’ll be looking in; the key to submitting an enticing offer is to eliminate as many unknowns as possible—for the seller’s sake and your own.&nbsp;

**We here at the Vickie Landis Rentsel Team have some great strategies for getting our buyers under contract**, and we’ve had much success with them lately.
