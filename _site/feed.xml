        <title>A Crash Course on the Science of Properly Disinfecting Surfaces</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jR8gXfTvF1c&amp;amp;t?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we were fortunate enough to be joined by Ken Carfagno, a former mechanical engineer who started his own cleaning company in upstate New York, to discuss proper methods of disinfection—something we could all benefit from right now. Ken, who’s in the process of rebooting his business here in Philly, dropped some serious cleaning science to debunk common misconceptions. As it turns out, the overwhelming majority of us aren’t doing nearly enough when we try to disinfect our homes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch it in its entirety or use these timestamps to browse specific points at your leisure: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2:37 - Ken’s extensive research on coronavirus disinfection, and his shocking conclusion &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:43 - Cleaning mistake #1: Not &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; cleaning the surface first &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:40 - Cleaning mistake #2: Not choosing a registered disinfectant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:20 - Cleaning mistake #3: Not selecting the right disinfectant for the right pathogen &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:45 - Cleaning mistake #4: Not following instructions on the label to dilute correctly and wet surfaces long enough &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:58 - Cleaning mistake #5: Not using chemicals correctly (everything you know about bleach is wrong) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15:22 - Cleaning mistake #6: Cross-contamination from rags or not wearing gloves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16:54 - Cleaning mistake #7: Not using the right pH for a surface and thereby damaging it &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19:22 - Cleaning mistake #8: Mixing chemicals—it could kill you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20:23 - Cleaning mistake #9: Not fully cleaning a surface &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you disinfect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22:12 - How to learn more cleaning tips from Ken&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to give a huge thank you to Ken for sharing his expertise during a time when it’s most needed. As always, if you have questions or concerns regarding real estate, please feel free to reach out by phone or email. We’re here for you. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Your May 2020 Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FcTWEf0TsRc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how COVID-19 has impacted the real estate process in Pennsylvania. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the stay-at-home order was put in place, it became illegal for real estate agents to show properties in person, which has had an obvious impact on home sales. Mind you, homes are still selling, just not at the rate that we would’ve expected given the trending we’d observed prior to the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ours was a seller’s market all through 2019, and it’s still a seller’s market, though with the onset of the virus, many sellers began to pull their properties off the market, and buyers took a step back to assess what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=A seller who waits is likely to get lost in the competition of the other listings that flood the market.%20http://localhost:4000/your-may-2020-market-update.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“A seller who waits is likely to get lost in the competition of the other listings that flood the market.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the last several weeks, though, &lt;strong&gt;buyers have come back to the market&lt;/strong&gt;, which has become very demanding. We’re getting multiple bids on properties, even in a time when buyers can’t physically preview a property. These are all signs that we need to pay attention to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the governor’s plan to reopen Pennsylvania, &lt;strong&gt;as soon as the county you live in turns yellow on the map that tracks infection rates, agents can go back to work, and sellers can let buyers into their homes to preview their properties before they submit an offer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a seller who wants to get your property on the market, don’t wait—as soon as the light turns green (or in this case, yellow), buyers will already be lined up at the starting gate before they bust through and snatch up all the properties available for purchase. A seller who waits is likely to get lost in the competition of the other listings that flood the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a buyer who hasn’t already gotten pre-approved for a loan and you haven’t aligned yourself with a real estate professional who can negotiate on your behalf, &lt;strong&gt;you need to do that now.&lt;/strong&gt; You can’t bust through the gates and win the negotiation game if you don’t have the proper foundation laid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My team and I are here to help you. If you have any questions or need any assistance, reach out to us. We’re happy to give you information and the resources you need so that you’ll be ready when the light turns yellow.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Quick Market Update</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4QJrWX6H8o?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sharing our latest real estate market update and how the pandemic has impacted it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m sharing a quick real estate market update. Many of you have reached out to us asking what effect the pandemic is having on the real estate industry and how it will impact your home values. Statistically, the most significant thing that has happened is that we’ve had more houses coming off the market, either because sellers decide it’s not the right time to sell or because the home has gone under contract. A ton of properties have gone on hold for the time being. However, even amid a health crisis, homes are still selling and being listed.   &lt;/p&gt;
