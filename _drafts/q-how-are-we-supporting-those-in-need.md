My team is joining with KW agents across the globe to serve our local communities. This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, **our team has chosen to focus our service specifically on those who are stepping up and serving on the front lines.**

Many of you are at home with time on your hands, too. So join us in showing your support on your front lawn. We’ve designed a sign that we can bring to your yard to show your support for those who have spent a lifetime dedicating themselves to serving others. **They need a little extra support right now, so let’s get together and help.**

You can help at [support4frontline.com](http://support4frontline.com) to order a sign and learn more about what we’re doing. If you know of someone who needs help during this time, email us and we’ll see what we can do.

If you have any other questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
